jenkinsflow
===========

Python API with high level build flow constructs (parallel/serial) for Jenkins (and Hudson).
Allows full scriptable control over the execution of Jenkins jobs.
Also allows running 'jobs' without using Jenkins (for testing without reloading Jenkins jobs).

See INSTALL.md for installation and test setup.
See demo/... for some usage examples.
I don't test continuously on Hudson, but patches are welcome.

Thanks to Aleksey Maksimov for contributing various bits, including the graph visualization.
