    """Utility method to set/append build description on a job build.

    If this is used from inside the hudson job you do not have to specify 'build_url' or 'job_name', 'build_number'. You do not have to specify 'direct_url' either
    but may still want to do so if JENKINS_URL points to a proxy, so that rest calls can go directly to Jenkins.
    The 'build_url' is preferred over 'job_name' and 'build_number'.

    Args:
        description: The description to set on the build.
        replace: Replace existing description, if any, instead of appending.
        separator: A separator to insert between any existing description and the new 'description' if 'replace' is not specified.
        username: User Name for Jenkin authentication with secured Jenkins.
        password: Password of Jenkins User.
        build_url: The URL of the jenkins build - preferably non-proxied. Default is os.environ['BUILD_URL'].
        job_name: Name of the job to modify a build on. Default is os.environ['JOB_NAME'].
        build_number: Build Number to modify. . Default is os.environ['BUILD_NUMBER'].
        direct_url: Jenkins URL - preferably non-proxied. If not specified, the value of JENKINS_URL or HUDSON_URL environment variables will be used.
